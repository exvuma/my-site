        Was so excited to read on when I could feel the emotional irony in the
        ending of the first chapter where Galloway mentions that the results of
        googling his name appears after some professional athete:
        <i>"those bastards" </i>. I googled this, however, and is no longer
        true. Maybe because the release of this book helped his SEO? Although I
        did appreciate the personality and candidness of Galloway's rants, I did
        find he dedicated a little too much time to his experience and
        relationships in the newspaper business.

        What I found most compelling about this read was breaking into the
        education market and the middle class' existence in the digital age.

      <h2 className='section-heading'>Disappearing Middle Class</h2>

      <p className='post'>
        Galloway introduces, in quite a scary realization, that if the economy
        keeps trending as is than a very small group of exception people will
        control a mass percent of the world's wealth.

        It's never been easier to be a billionaire and harder to be a
        millionaire
      </blockquote>

      <p className='post'>
        Not saying a millionaire is by any means "middle class" but it is the
        upper middle class. I found this quote so intriguing because we all want
        to be billionaires, but more realistically we could actually strive for
        millionaires. It seems like that attainable goal is only getting less
        realistic. There may be more lottery winners, but statistically your are
        still wasting your dollar by buying a ticket.

        A lot of the book I found cynical. An optimistic approach to the digital
        age is the disappearance of the factory worker. Machines do factory work
        now. We are useful when we are not acting as machines but as creative,
        intelligent and emotional human beings. Making it in the digital age
        will mean putting your humanity into your work. Sure there my be less
        jobs, which don't get me wrong is scary, but there will be more human
        jobs. Who wants to act as machines anyways? The world's fascination and
        the success of the show "Shark Tank" displays how consumers love small
        businesses. With the availability of information from Google, of
        marketplace from Amazon and of communication from Facebook there are
        huge opportunities for not just the rich, but for everyone for free.
        Yes, I left out Apple there because I personally don't think Apple gives
        much more than the image dysmorphia of being sexy.

      <h2 className='section-heading'>Market for Higher Education</h2>

      <p className='post'>
        I will expand on the only way I see Apple truely impacting the world
        post-Jobs. The most eye opening ideas from the book was the idea of the
        next disrupted market being education. I admire the brilliance and
        forthcoming idea of Apple investing in a presidios university.

        My favorite part of the digital age is the power of the people over
        "evil" markets. Uber taking over taxi industry, Amazon taking over
        highly inflated market of shipping (even though as Galloway pointed out
        much throughout the book Amazon isn't exactly doing this fairly). To
        have education be the next disrupted market would be huge. The stats on
        increasing tuition costs and competition for admission these days is
        ridiculous and institutes are only getting increasingly worst year over
        year.

        From the graph above we can see how consumer price index increases much
        more rapidly for college students above other sectors of education.
        Companies like Chegg have grown hugely successful by jumping on this
        increase. Chegg began as a college textbook rental company for students.
        College textbooks are still the largest increasing sector in education
        costs but Chegg is putting a dent in what students are actually
        spending. The amount students are actually spending on textbooks -
        despite the insane rising cost of a new textbook - has stayed relatively
        flat at about $600/year due to companies like Chegg that are allowing
        students the options of buying used, renting or saleing books to one
        another [According to Student Monitor and Quoctrung Bui/NPR] Now, lets
        image Apple - one of the most massive and powerful organizations of
        human talent - taking this same approach to college instruction and
        tuition.

        Why would Apple do this? While clearly starting a college does deviate
        from the business model of a typical hardware company, Apple is not
        typical. The acquisition of hot talent is what makes companies
        successfully in the digital age. Having first dibs on that hot talent is
        a big advantage. Also, there is a lot of money in education. Parents
        would be racing to fork up money to get their kids in at what would
        likely lead to a direct job at Apple. Kids would be racing to get
        admission to this cool new school - well at least the smart kids.

        Overall I think Scott Galloway's combination of research, data, sense
        and business knownledge analyzes the four "horseman" on point with
        reality. Yes, I may be a little biased as I can align with the honest,
        cut to the chase personality of Galloway not to mention he was a follow
        Bruin. But, bias aside if you haven't read "the four" already it's worth
        a read <i>or</i> a listen like I did on Audible.

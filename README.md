# victoriabernard.com

Currently lives on a Cloudflare worker using wrangler and raw bootstrap HTML/CSS/JS (`./victoriabernard.com`)

Very dated as most code lives from 2016. In progress of migrating to NextJS and React in `/next-blog`

# Run old site

```
cd victoriabernard.com
```

open an html file statically

Note: this is very dated

# Run next js site

yarn dev
```
